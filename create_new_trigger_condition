//Please follow the below steps to create a new filter conditon for GTM Triggers

Step 1: Go to the triggers panel in GTM and open any trigger 
Step 2: Add the desired condition/filter in any one trigger you want to apply/update in all the triggers
Step 3: Don't forget to note down the trigger name you have updated
Step 4: Export the updated container and search the name of the edited trigger in trigger block
Step 5: Once located, go into the filter condition block and copy the filter block you added in the trigger in GTM Interface.

The filter condition block should look like this:

//Filter Condition Block
{
    "type": "CONTAINS",
    "parameter": [
      {
          "type": "TEMPLATE",
          "key": "arg0",
          "value": "{{OptanonGroups}}"
      },
      {
          "type": "TEMPLATE",
          "key": "arg1",
          "value": ",4,"
       }
     ]
}

//Continue reading the article further to assign this to java script variable and to proceed further
//Also, you can also create the filter condition in testing environment/workspace as we just need the filter condition block
